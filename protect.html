                    <p><b>Mental Health:</b></p>
                    Mental illness is a term used to describe mental health conditions that impact mood, thinking, and behavior. These disorders may interfere with a personâ€™s ability to relate to others and function on a daily basis.

                    <p><b>Bring Awareness to Mental Health Symptoms</b></p>
                    Mental health awareness initiatives help those who are suffering to understand how the symptoms of mental health disorders manifest. This allows individuals to seek treatment BEFORE their condition worsens and prevents significant disruptions to their social or work life.

                <li>
                    <p><b>Break the Mental Health Stigma</b></p>
                    Mental health awareness initiatives aim at raising public knowledge of mental health disorders, reducing stigma and fostering positive attitudes towards seeking help.

Mental health awareness helps people understand that mental illness is NOT a character flaw but rather an illness like any other.
Help Break the Stigma: Insist on destigmatizing this issue in society through your everyday interactions with your friends, family members, colleagues at work and even strangers around you.
